----------------------------------------------------------------

Reggie Next 2 is a powerful rewrite of the Reggie! Level Editor, designed to support more games and features.

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Getting Started

If you're on Windows and don't care about having the latest bleeding-edge features, you can use the official installer. This is by far the easiest setup method. The installer will take care of everything for you.

If you're not on Windows or you want the very latest features, you'll need to run Reggie Next from source.


### How to Run Reggie Next from Source

Download and install the following:
 * Python 3.4 (or newer) - http://www.python.org
 * PyQt 5.4 (or newer) - http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro
 * cx_Freeze 4.3 (or newer) (optional) - http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net
 * TPLLib (latest version) - https://github.com/RoadrunnerWMC/TPLLib
 * PyOpenGL 3.1 (or newer) - http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net

Run the following in a command prompt:
`python3 reggienext.py`
You can replace `python3` with the path to python.exe (including "python.exe" at the end) and `reggienext.py` with the path to reggie.py (including "reggienext.py" at the end)
